 Understood the Massachusetts Roads Segmentation Dataset and wrote a custom dataset class for Image-mask dataset. Applied segmentation domain augmentations to augment images as well as its masks. For image-mask augmentation used albumentation library. Plotted the image-Mask pair.
 Loaded a pretrained state of the art convolutional neural network for segmentation problem(for e.g, Unet) using segmentation model pytorch library. 
 Created train function and evaluator function which was used to write training loop. Used training loop to train the model.
 Finally, used best trained segementation model for inference.
SKILLS: Convolutional Neural Network, Python Programming,pytorch
